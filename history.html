        The human history of the Yellowstone region goes back more than 11,000
        years. The stories of people in Yellowstone are preserved in
        archeological sites and objects that convey information about past human
        activities in the region, and in people’s connections to the land that
        provide a sense of place or identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, park managers use archeological and historical studies to help us
        understand how people lived here in the past. Ethnography helps us learn
        about how groups of people identify themselves and their connections to
        the park. Research is also conducted to learn how people continue to
        affect and be affected by these places, many of which have been
        relatively protected from human impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some alterations to the landscape, such as the construction of roads and
        other facilities, are generally accepted as necessary to accommodate the
        needs of visitors today. Information on the possible consequences of
        modern human activities, both inside and outside the parks, is used to
        determine how best to preserve Yellowstone’s natural and cultural
        resources, and the quality of the visitors’ experience.

        Yellowstone National Park’s mission includes preserving and interpreting
        evidence of past human activity through archeology and historic
        preservation; features that are integral to how a group of people
        identifies itself (ethnographic resources); and places associated with a
        significant event, activity, person or group of people that provide a
        sense of place and identity (historic buildings, roads, and cultural
        landscapes).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to archeological sites and artifacts associated with
        prehistoric human use of the region, there are many historic districts,
        historic structures, and cultural landscapes that are essential to the
        inherent value of Yellowstone National Park.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the park’s developed areas are within historic districts that
        contain hundreds of cultural resources such as buildings, bridges,
        trails and roads (linear resources), and cultural landscape features
        (overlooks, vegetation) that have historic, architectural, and/or
        engineering significance. The majority of Yellowstone’s hotels, lodges,
        general stores, residences, maintenance shops, and offices are listed on
        or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
