<p>Yellowstone’s abundant and diverse wildlife are as famous as its geysers. There are nearly 300 species of birds, 16 species of fish, five species of amphibians, six species of reptiles, and 67 species of mammals—including seven native ungulate species and two bear species.</p>

<label for="title1">How can I tell the difference between a black bear and a grizzly bear when I'm in the park?</label>

<div class="content">
<p>Yellowstone is home to two species of bears: grizzly bears and black bears. Of the two species, grizzly bears have a much smaller range across the United States. The grizzly bear is typically larger than the black bear and has a large muscle mass above its shoulders; a concave, rather than straight or convex, facial profile; and much more aggressive behavior.</p>

<label for="title2">How can I keep myself safe from dangerous wildlife encounters in the park?</label>

<div class="content">
<p>Wild animals, especially females with young, are unpredictable and dangerous. Keep a safe distance from all wildlife. Each year a number of park visitors are injured by wildlife when approaching too closely. Approaching on foot within 100 yards (91 m) of bears or wolves, or within 25 yards (23 m) of other wildlife is prohibited. Please use roadside pullouts when viewing wildlife. Use binoculars or telephoto lenses for safe viewing and to avoid disturbing wildlife.</p>

<input type="checkbox" id="title3" />
<label for="title3">What steps can I take to stay safe if I encounter a grizzly bear?</label>

<div class="content">
<p>If a bear doesn't see you, keep out of sight and detour as far as possible behind and downwind of the bear. If the bear sees you, retreat slowly and leave the area.  Do not drop to the ground and “play dead.” Do not run, shout, or make sudden movements: you don't want to startle the bear. Running may trigger a chase response in the bear and you can't outrun a bear. Draw your bear spray from the holster, remove the safety tab, and prepare to use it if the bear charges.</p>

<label for="title4">How many species of animals are in the park?</label>

<input type="checkbox" id="title5" />
<label for="title5">How does the time of year I visit affect what wildlife I'm likely to encounter?</label>

<div class="content">
<p>Habitat preferences and seasonal cycles of movement determine, in a general sense, where a particular animal may be at a particular time. Early morning and evening hours are when animals tend to be feeding and are more easily seen. But remember that the numbers and variety of animals you see are largely a matter of luck and coincidence.</p>
